# ðŸ“ˆ **Excel Functions in Python**
![alt text](screenshot.png)


This project is about recreating some common Excel functions in Python. The idea is simple: many people are used to working in Excel, but Python is more powerful for larger projects.  So I decided to show how Excel-style functions can be written and used in Python.

## ðŸ”¹ **Why I Built This**
- To practice and show my coding skills in Python.  
- To make it easier for people who already know Excel to see how things translate into Python.  
- To create a starting point for a bigger portfolio where Iâ€™ll keep adding useful functions and projects.

## ðŸ”¹ **Whatâ€™s Inside**
The functions are grouped into:
### ðŸ§® **Math Functions**
####  **1. SUM()**
---

- **Description:**  
    - Implemented as `excel_sum(*numbers)` in Python.  
    - Replicates Excelâ€™s `=SUM()` behaviour:  
        - Accepts lists, tuples, Series, or DataFrames as ranges.  
        - Ignores logical values (`TRUE` / `FALSE`) and text inside ranges, just like Excel.  
        - Raises `TypeError` for invalid inputs (similar to Excelâ€™s `#NAME?` error).  
        - Can handle more than 255 arguments, unlike Excelâ€™s limit.  



- **How Excel Shows It:**  
This is how Excel presents the SUM function in its *Function Arguments* window:
